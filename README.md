Java + Spring Boot 2 + JOOQ + Flyway + Gradle

1.  Please kindly put your Google API key as a value mapped to the key 'google.api.key' 
    in src/main/resources/application.properties
    
2.  The start.sh will stop and remove service which names 'mysql_lalamove'. Please BEWARE!!
    The start.sh will create a mysql DB by Docker Compose.
    The SQL files of the schema and dummy data will be executed by Flyway.
    All the DB related Java files will be generated by JOOQ.
    When the DB is ready, the spring boot application will start the process of testing.
    When all the test cases pass, the application will start with listening to port 8080.
